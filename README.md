UIEB Dataset: A benchmark dataset for underwater image enhancement and restoration tasks.

This project evaluates the performance of three different image denoising filters â€” Gaussian Blur, Median Blur, and Bilateral Filter â€” using the UIEB (Underwater Image Enhancement Benchmark) dataset. The effectiveness of each filter is measured using the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR).
